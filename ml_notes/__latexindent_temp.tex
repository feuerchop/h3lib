\section{Linear Models}
\subsection{Regression}
It seems everything starts to grow from linear model, whatever regression or classification, linear models expand to almost many other learning models we face during the research. So starting from a very simple linear regression problem, given training set $\set D = \left\{ \vct x_i, \vct y_i \right\}_{i=1}^n $ with $ n $ sample, where $ \vct y $ are the responses as numerical values. A linear regression model finds a linear weight vector, which minimizes a certain type of empirical error. This is obviously defined in perspective of statistical learning theory. 
\begin{equation}
\argmin_{\vct w} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \| w^T x_i + b - y_i\|^2
\end{equation}
where empirical error introduced by individual sample is equally weighted by $ 1/n $. It is seen that we are using a straight line to fit a possibly any shaped function, obviously the summation or mean error can be large due to the noise or intrinsic nonlinearity of function. However, a typical misunderstanding of linear model for beginners is that the term linear refers to $ \vct w $ instead of $ \vct x $. That is to say, we are expecting a linear model on parameters $ \vct w $, but the feature vectors $ \vct x $ can actually be any shape. Therefore, in literature we mostly see a feature mapping of input $ \vct x $ as $ \phi(\vct x) $, and it does not break the linear property of the model. Therefore, we have our liner model as,
\begin{equation}
\argmin_{\vct w} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \| w^T \phi(x_i) + b - y_i\|^2
\label{eq:linear_reg}
\end{equation}
A typical feature mapping is polynomial feature mapping. Suppose we have a 2-dimensional input data sample $ \left( x_1, x_2 \right) $, we define a feature mapping as follows,
\[ \left( x_1, x_2 \right) \rightarrow \left( x_1, x_2, x_1^2+x_2^2 \right), \] where a 2-d plane is transformed as a paraboloid in 3-d space. Substituting back into previous linear function, it becomes a polynomial line fitting problem, but it is still linear in $ \vct w $.

To solve the least square problem defined in Eq. \ref{eq:linear_reg} to obtain an optimal parameter estimation $ \vct w $, we take the gradient with respect to the loss and set it to zero. Note that the intercept $ b $ can be folded in vector $ \vct w $ by adding additional entry $1$ in the end, for simplicity, we ignore it in our formulation. The least square solution is,
\begin{equation}
\vct w^* = \left( \Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X) \right)^{-1}\Phi(\vct X)^T\vct Y
\label{eq:lsq_sol}
\end{equation}
As long as the $ \Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X) $ is not singular, there exists analytical solution. We will call $ \Phi(\vct X) $ design matrix, which takes each row as a feature mapping on $ \vct x $. We will see in short that the inner product of feature mapping can be explicitly defined by a certain kernel function, which established a very important chapter of learning theory, \ie \textit{Kernel Methods}. To predict the response for a new sample $ \vct x^* $, we have,
\[ \vct y^* = \phi(\vct x^*) \left( \Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X) \right)^{-1}\Phi(\vct X)^T\vct Y \]

\subsubsection*{From Probabilistic View}
Different from minimizing empirical errors from observations, we can examine the whole problem in a probabilistic view, that is, minimize the uncertainty from observations. If we reformulate the problem as a summation of a deterministic function and a indeterministic noise from a certain probabilistic distribution, we can write the linear model as,
\[ \vct y = \vct w^T \phi(\vct x) + \epsilon \], where $ \epsilon \sim \set N\left( 0, \sigma^2 \right)$ which is defined as a Gaussian noise, the bias term $ b $ is again folded in $ \vct w $. Moreover, we can get the response $ \vct Y $ as a Gaussian distribution as well. 
\[ \vct Y \sim \prod_{i=1}^n \set N\left( \vct w^T\phi(\vct x_i), \sigma^2 \right) \]
In order to get the optimal parameter $ \vct w $, we need to maximize the likelihood $ p\left( \vct Y\mid \vct X, \vct w \right) $. It equals to maximize the log-likelihood, and the log-likelihood gives,
\begin{equation}
\ln p\left( \vct Y \mid \vct X, \vct w \right) = -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi)-n\ln(\sigma) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\vct Y - \Phi(\vct X)\vct w\|^2
\label{eq:mle}
\end{equation}
From Eq.\ref{eq:mle}, we can see maximizing the log-likelihood (\textit{MLE}) equals minimizing the least squared error. We will get the exact same solution as in Eq.\ref{eq:lsq_sol}. 

\subsubsection*{Overfitting}
Now suppose we have four 1-dimensional observations $ \vct X $, and define an arbitrary feature mapping $ \phi $, we expect to find a linear model to minimize the least squared error, as we see in \eqref{eq:linear_reg}. 
\[ \bmat{2 \\ 1 \\-1} = \phi\left( \bmat{1.5 \\ 0.5 \\ 2.5} \right)  \vct w \]
If we define the feature mapping $ \phi $ as 
\[  \bmat{1.5 \\ 0.5 \\ 2.5} \xrightarrow{\phi} \bmat{1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1}\]
We can see that $ \vct w $ is exactly the response vector $ \vct y $, and the least squared error is minimized as zero. A feature mapping can always be defined to achieve zero error, if there's no constraints at all. But obviously, there is no benefit to use this linear model on any prediction task, and mostly likely we will get a very high prediction error based on that. If the model performs well on training dataset, but poorly on unseen data, we can call this situation as overfitting. And certainly, overfitting is a central problem that machine learning attempts to solve. 

To avoid overfitting, we can firstly introduce constraint by adding a penalty term on the complexity of the $ \vct w $, which is known as \textit{regularization}. For example, by penalizing a 2-norm of $ \vct w $, we can generalize the least squared error problem as,
\begin{equation}
\argmin_{\vct w} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \| \vct w^T \phi(x_i) + b - y_i\|^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2}\vct w^T\vct w 
\label{l2norm}
\end{equation}
Similarly taking the derivative w.r.t. $ \vct w $ and set to zero, we can get the optimal parameters as,
\begin{equation}
\vct w^* = \left( \Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X) + \lambda \vct I \right)^{-1}\Phi(\vct X)^T\vct Y
\label{eq:lsq_reg_sol}
\end{equation}
Again from probabilistic view, we introduce uncertainty on $ \vct w $ instead of only considering uncertainty on response $ \vct y $. Define a prior on $ \vct w $ following a D-dimensional Gaussian distribution,
\[ \vct w \sim \set N\left( \vct 0, \Sigma_{\vct w} \right) \] 
We want to capture the posterior distribution on $ \vct w $ after observations of $ \left( \vct X, \vct Y \right) $, that is, the objective is to maximize the posterior according to Bayes theorem,
\begin{equation}
\max p\left( \vct w \mid \vct X, \vct Y \right) = \frac{p\left( \vct Y \mid \vct X, \vct w \right)p\left( \vct w \right)}{\int p\left( \vct Y \mid \vct X, \vct w \right)p\left( \vct w \right)d\vct w}
\label{eq:posterior}
\end{equation}
The denominator in Eq.\ref{eq:posterior} is also called marginal likelihood, which is independent of $ \vct w $, therefore, taking the logarithm of the posterior, we have,
\begin{equation}
\ln p\left( \vct w \mid \vct X, \vct Y \right) = -\frac{(n+d)}{2}\ln(2\pi)-n\ln(\Sigma_{\vct w}) - \frac{1}{2}\ln|\Sigma_{\vct w}|- \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\|\vct Y - \Phi(\vct X)\vct w\|^2 - \frac{1}{2}\vct w^T\Sigma_{\vct w}^{-1}\vct w 
\label{eq:ln_posterior}
\end{equation}
Take the gradient w.r.t. $ \vct w $ and set to zero, we can get very similar results as in Eq.\ref{eq:lsq_reg_sol}.
\begin{equation}
\vct w_{map} = \left( \Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X) + \sigma^2\vct \Sigma_{\vct w}^{-1} \right)^{-1}\Phi(\vct X)^T\vct Y
\label{map_sol}
\end{equation}
If the prior is defined with an isotropic Gaussian, we see that the \textit{MAP} solution is equivalent to $ \ell_2 $ regularization form. Now let us look back at the posterior, note that,
\begin{align}
p\left( \vct w \mid \vct X, \vct Y \right) & \propto p\left( \vct Y \mid \vct X, \vct w \right)p\left( \vct w \right)  \nonumber\\
& \propto \exp \left\lbrack -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left( \Phi(\vct X)\vct w - \vct Y\right)^T\left( \Phi(\vct X)\vct w - \vct Y\right) \right\rbrack \exp \left( \frac{1}{2}\vct w^T\Sigma_{\vct w}^{-1}\vct w \right)  \nonumber\\
& \propto \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}\vct w^T\left( \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\Phi(\vct X)^T \Phi(\vct X) + \Sigma_{\vct w}^{-1}\right)\vct w + \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\vct Y^T\Phi(\vct X)\vct w \right\}
\end{align}
By completing the square we can get the mean and covariance of the posterior, that is, 
\begin{align}
 \vct w^* &\sim\set N \left( \vct m^*,  \vct A^{-1} \right) \nonumber \\
 \vct m^* &= \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \vct A^{-1} \Phi(\vct X)^T\vct Y \\
  \vct A  &= \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\Phi(\vct X)^T\Phi(\vct X)+\Sigma_{\vct w}^{-1}
\end{align}
And we see that the \textit{MAP} solution is exactly the same as the mode of the posterior. To predict a new input sample $ \vct x^* $, we can derive a predictive distribution instead of just a single value at the mode, and it is again a Gaussian with posterior mean multiplied with the test sample, and variance of the predictive distribution is the quadratic form on the posterior covariance, which grows with the magnitude of test samples. 
\begin{align} 
	p(\vct y^* \mid \vct X, \vct Y, \vct x^*) & = \int p(\vct y^*\mid \vct X, \vct Y, \vct w, \vct x^*)p(\vct w \mid \vct X, \vct Y)d\vct w  \nonumber \\
	& \sim \set N\left( \vct \Phi(\vct x^*)^T \vct m^*, \Phi(\vct x^*)^T \vct A^{-1} \Phi(\vct x^*) \right)
\end{align}


\subsection{Classification}
Now let us consider classification problem, where we expect a functional $ \pi(\vct x) $ to map input $ \vct x $ to class labels, in binary case $ \vct y=\left( +1, -1 \right) $. More commonly, we can define a Bernoulli distribution $ p(y=+1 \mid x) $ for one class and $ 1-p\left( y=+1 \mid x \right) $ for another. Typically, we would choose a sigmoid function, \eg logistic function or \textit{tanh} to warp a possibly infinite value into a bounding box, \eg, $ \left\lbrack 0, 1 \right\rbrack $ for logistic function. This is a desired behavior, since any function value will be transformed to a probability. A logistic function is defined,
\[ \sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)} \]
Obviously, we also have, 
\begin{align*}
\sigma(-a) = 1-\sigma(a) \\
\tanh(a) = 2\sigma(2a) -1 \\
\diff{\sigma(a)}{a} = \left( 1-\sigma(a) \right)\sigma(a)
\end{align*}
Thus, the conditional class distribution given input dataset can be defined as a sigmoid function on the linear model $ p\left( y \mid \vct x \right) = \sigma(yf(\vct x))$, again we fold the bias term $ b $ in the parameters $ \vct w $. 

\section{Gaussian Process}
\subsection{Regression}
\label{sec:gpr}
Gaussian process is an important nonparametric regression model which looks for an optimal functional in a space of functions, that minimizes a loss function, although the loss function needs not to be explicitly defined. \cite{rw06gp}

Give a training dataset $\set D = \left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ with $x_i \in R^d$, \textit{i.i.d} drawn from certain distribution, we are interested at the predictive distribution of unknown target for the  test sample $x_*$, denoted as $f_*$. Suppose a prior over $\vct y$ given input $\vct X$ is a $n$-variable Gaussian distribution,
\[
\vct y \sim \set N(\vct 0, K(\vct X, \vct X))
\]
where $K(\vct X, \vct X)$ defines a covariance function over $\vct X$. Therefore the posterior of $f_*$ given the training dataset $\set D$ is also a Gaussian.
\[
f_*|\vct y, \vct X, x_* \sim \set N(\mu_*, \Sigma_*^{-1})
\]
where the sufficient statistics can be derived using Bayesian theorem,
\begin{align}
	& \bar{f_*} = \vct k_{*}^T (\vct K +\sigma_n^2 I)^{-1}\vct y \label{eq:gpr_mu}\\
	& \bb{V}(f_*) = k(\vct x_*, \vct x_*) - \vct k_{*}^T (\vct K+\sigma_n^2 I)^{-1} \vct k_{*}  \label{eq:gpr_cov}
\end{align}
where $\sigma_n^2$ is the noise level, $\vct K$ represents a shorthand for covariance matrix on input $ \vct X $, and we denote $ \vct k_{*} $ as the kernel function $ k(\vct X, \vct x_*) $ for simplicity.
%\question{Here comes the question of how to estimate the parameters for the covariance $K$.}

To obtain the Eq.\eqref{eq:gpr_mu}-\eqref{eq:gpr_cov}, we can use the following trick.
Given two variables $(\vct x, \vct y)$ following a Gaussian distribution,
\[
\bmat{\vct x\\ \vct y} \sim \set N\left(
\bmat{\mu_x \\ \mu_y}, \bmat{A & C \\ C^T & B}
\right)
\]
Then we have the conditional distribution,
\[
\vct x|\vct y \sim \set N\left(\mu_x+CB^{-1}(\vct y - \mu_y), A - C^TB^{-1}C \right)
\]

Now looking at the predictive mean of training dataset, which can be given by Eq.\eqref{eq:gpr_mu}-\eqref{eq:gpr_cov} on training set $ \vct X $ itself, 
\[ \bar{f} = \vct K(\vct K + \sigma_n^2 I)^{-1}\vct y \]

Since $ \vct K $ is symmetric positive definite and its eigendecomposition is $ \vct K=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i\vct u_i \vct u_i^T$, where $ \lambda_i $ is the \textit{i}th eigenvalue and $ \vct u_i $ is the \textit{i}th eigenvector. Now define a vector $ \vct U=\bmat{\vct u_1, \ldots, \vct u_n} $, therefore we have $ \vct K = \vct U\Sigma\vct U^T $. According the the matrix inverse lemma [\cite{mil86}], we can derive a simple form for the predictive mean, where we observe that the predictive mean is a linear smooth on their targets. 

\begin{align*}
\bar{f} & = \vct K\left( \sigma_n^{-2}I - \sigma_n^{-2}I\vct U \left( \Sigma^{-1}+\vct U^T\sigma_n^{-2}I\vct U \right)^{-1}\vct U^T\sigma_n^{-2}I\right)\vct y \\
& = \vct K\left( \sigma_n^{-2}I - \sigma_n^{-2}\vct U \left( \Sigma^{-1}+\sigma_n^{-2}I \right)^{-1}\vct U^T\sigma_n^{-2}\right)\vct y \\
& = \left( \sigma_n^{-2}\vct U\Sigma\vct U^T - \vct U\Sigma
			\bmat{\frac{\lambda_1\sigma_n^{-2}}{\lambda_1+\sigma_n^{2}} & & \\ 
						& \ddots & \\ 
						& & \frac{\lambda_n\sigma_n^{-2}}{\lambda_n+\sigma_n^{2}}}
		\vct U^T \right)\vct y \\
& = \left( \sigma_n^{-2}\vct U\Sigma\vct U^T - \sigma_n^{-2}\vct U
\bmat{\frac{\lambda_1^2}{\lambda_1+\sigma_n^{2}} & & \\ 
	& \ddots & \\ 
	& & \frac{\lambda_n^2}{\lambda_n+\sigma_n^{2}}}
\vct U^T \right)\vct y \\
& = \left( \sigma_n^{-2}\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\vct u_i\vct u_i^T - \sigma_n^{-2}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda_i^{2}}{\lambda_i + \sigma_n^2}\vct u_i\vct u_i^T \right)\vct y \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \sigma_n^2}\vct u_i\vct u_i^T\vct y \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\gamma_i\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \sigma_n^2}\vct u_i, \quad \text{with } \gamma_i = \vct u_i^T\vct y
\end{align*}

\subsection{Classification}
Using Gaussian process for classification task is a bit more complicated than regression. The main idea of it is to use a `squash' function to convert a predicted function value within $\left[ 0, 1\right]$, \eg, sigmoid function, cumulative Gaussian \textit{pdf}. Given a dataset $\set D = \left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ with $x_i \in R^d$ and corresponding labels $\vct y=\left[ +1,-1 \right] $

\section{Support Vector Machines}


\section{PCA}
The basic idea of PCA is to maximally reduce information loss of projecting high dimensional data to lower dimension. Therefore, an intuitive consideration would be that we introduce first of all a projection matrix $\vct u$ on $d$-dimensional instance $x$, so that $x$ is mapped on a lower $m$-dimensional space. Following column vector routine, we expect that matrix $\vct u$ as being $m \times d$. Now given a dataset $ \vct X = \left\{  x_i\right\}_{i=1}^{n}$, it will be projected on a $ m $-dimensional space by $\vct u$. The objective of the projection is to maximize the covariance of data on the lower dimensional space, that is,
\[
	\max \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\|\vct ux - \vct u\bar{x}\|^2
\]
that can be rewritten as,
\begin{eqnarray}
	& \underset{\vct u}{\textit{maximize}}\quad \vct u S \vct u^T \nonumber \\
	\text{s.t.} & \vct u_i\vct u_i^T = 1, \,\, i=1,\ldots,m
	\label{eq:pca_obj}
\end{eqnarray}
where $S$ is the covariance of $\vct X$. To prevent $\vct u$ goes to infinity, we assume $\vct u$ has unit length, namely, $\vct u$ represents a set of basis of the lower dimension.

According to \eqref{eq:pca_obj}, we introduce $m$ Lagrangian multipliers $\vct \lambda$ as a diagonal matrix, and we have
\[ L = \underset{\vct u}{\textit{maximize}}\quad \vct u S \vct u^T - \vct\lambda \vct u\vct u^T \]

Take the derivative of $L$ with respect to $\vct u$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
	\vct uS & = & \vct\lambda\vct u \nonumber \\
	S & = & \vct u^{-1}\lambda\vct u
	\label{eq:pca_sol}
\end{eqnarray}
Since $\vct u$ is orthogonal, it is therefore not singular. We see that $\vct u$ and $\vct lambda$ are the indeed the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for $S$ respectively. And Eq.\eqref{eq:pca_sol} is exactly the singular value decomposition of $S=U\Sigma V^T$, we can derive $\vct u$ and $ \vct{\lambda} $ from $S$ conveniently.

\section{Anomaly Detection: A Survey}
In this section, I review literatures of importance in regard of anomaly detection in recent years, a more thorough survey of this research domain can be found also in \cite{Hodge2004, Chandola2009}. 

\section{Supervised Sequence Labeling}
The problem of supervised sequence labeling \cite{Graves2013} is to assign a sequence of labels given an input sequence. Suppose we have input sequence of length $ m $: $ \vct x_i = \left\lbrace x_i^{0}, x_i^{1}, \ldots, x_i^{m}\right\rbrace $, we aim to learn a function which assigns a sequence of labels $ \vct t_i $ of length $ s $ on $ \vct x_i $. That is, 
\begin{align*}
& f(x_i)  = \vct t_i, \\
\text{where} \quad & \vct t_i = \left\lbrace t_i^{0}, t_i^{1}, \ldots, t_i^{s}\right\rbrace
\end{align*}                 
For supervised sequence labeling, there's training labels available and accordingly there're
typically three types of learning tasks in sequence labeling.

\begin{description}
	\item[Sequence Classification] 
	It seeks a discriminative classification function to assign 
	singular label to a whole input sequence. This is a \textit{m-vs-1} relationship.
	For instances, a sentence type classifier automatically assigns a sentence to a type
	label. \textit{Who is president of USA?} is a \textit{question} sentence. 

	Error function for sequence classification can be as easy as normal binary or multiclass
	classification problem, e.g., using softmax cross entropy to measure the loss. 
	
	\item[Segment Classification] 
	Different from sequence classification, segment classifcation generates a shorter sequence 
	of labels that are assigned to segments of sequence. This is a \textit{m-vs-s} relationship.
	Namely we have $ | \vct t_i | < | \vct x_i |$. This is analog to image segmenation which 
	learns to segment image to different objects.
	
	Error function for segment classification can be set as percentage of misclassified segments.
	Denote the a test sequence dataset $S' = \left\lbrace (\vct x_i, \vct z_i)_{i=1}^N \right\rbrace$,
	and a segment classification function $h(\cdot)$, the segment error can be defined as, 
	\[
		E^{seg}(h, S') = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{(x,z)\in S'} \text{HD}(h(x), z),
	\]
	where \textbf{HD} is the hamming distance between two equal length sequences.

	\item[Temporal Classification] 
	Temporal classification is a \textit{N-vs-N} relationship. Each step of input sequence 
	generates a output label, it turns out the output length shall be equal to input sequence
	length. 

	A simple error function can be defined as edit distance of two sequences, namely the minimal
	number of \textit{insertions, substitutions and deletions}. 
	\[
		E^{Temp}(h, S') = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{(x,z)\in S'} \text{ED}(h(x), z),
	\]
	where \textbf{ED} is edit distance.
